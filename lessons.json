    "explanation": "**\n\nOkay everyone, imagine our solar system is like a really, really big playground! At the center of the playground is the Sun \u2013 a giant, glowing ball of fire and gas. The Sun is super important because it gives us light and warmth. It\u2019s like the biggest, brightest lightbulb you can imagine, but much, much bigger!\n\nNow, circling around the Sun are eight friends called planets. Think of them like kids playing tag around the Sun. Each planet travels in its own special path called an orbit. These planets are different sizes and made of different things.\n\nWe live on one of these planets called Earth! Earth is special because it has air and water, which allows plants, animals, and us to live here. Other planets like Mars are dry and dusty, while planets like Jupiter are giant balls of gas!\n\nThe closer a planet is to the Sun, the hotter it is. Mercury is closest, so it\u2019s scorching hot! The further away, like Neptune, the colder it is.\n\nA real-world example is seasons: The earth is tilted! when the northern hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, we experience summer. In the tilted away hemisphere, it's winter.\n**FUN FACTS**\n\n1.  If you could drive a car to the Sun, it would take you about 170 years, driving non-stop!\n2.  There's a giant storm on Jupiter that's bigger than Earth! It's been raging for hundreds of years.\n\n**",

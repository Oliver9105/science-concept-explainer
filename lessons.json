    "explanation": "The Solar System, a gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and all the objects that orbit it, extends far beyond the familiar planets. While we often think of planets like Earth and Jupiter, the Solar System includes dwarf planets, asteroids, comets, moons, and interplanetary dust and gas. The formation of the Solar System is primarily attributed to the nebular hypothesis. Around 4.6 billion years ago, a massive molecular cloud collapsed, likely triggered by a supernova shockwave. This collapse initiated a spinning protoplanetary disk where the Sun formed at the center, eventually igniting nuclear fusion.\n\nThe remaining material coalesced into protoplanets, influenced by factors like temperature gradients and orbital resonances. Closer to the Sun, high temperatures allowed only dense, rocky materials to condense, leading to the formation of terrestrial planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Further out, beyond the \"frost line,\" volatile compounds like water and methane could freeze, allowing gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn to accumulate massive amounts of hydrogen and helium. Uranus and Neptune, known as ice giants, formed even further out, with a greater proportion of heavier elements like oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur.\n\nBeyond Neptune lies the Kuiper Belt, a region containing icy bodies, including the dwarf planet Pluto. Farther still, the hypothesized Oort Cloud is a spherical shell of icy planetesimals that marks the gravitational boundary of the Solar System.\n\n**Real-World Example:** The James Webb Space Telescope's observations of protoplanetary disks surrounding young stars are providing unprecedented insights into the processes of planet formation, allowing us to test and refine our understanding of how our own Solar System came to be. Specifically, Webb's mid-infrared observations are capable of resolving the composition and distribution of dust and gas within these disks, revealing potential locations of future planet formation.\n\n## FUN FACTS\n\n1.  Venus rotates in the opposite direction of most planets in our solar system, a phenomenon potentially caused by a massive impact in its early history. This means the sun rises in the west and sets in the east on Venus!\n2. Jupiter's Great Red Spot, a giant storm larger than Earth, has been raging for at least 350 years! However, it's actually shrinking and scientists aren't sure why.\n\n##",
